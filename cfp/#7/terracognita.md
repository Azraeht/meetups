__title__: from cloud import infra

__expected time__ : 20m

__abstract__: In this talk, I will present Terracognita, open-source software designed to import your cloud infrastructure as code. We will import manually-deployed cloud resources from a project in Terraform format. This will allow us to convert our volatile components into an IaC (infrastructure as code) project.
